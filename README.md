# Keras Running on Google Colab with TPU Acceleration

NOTE: This code is out-of-date (it uses Tensorflow V1, in fact).

At some point I may update it to use TF V2 but for now it is obsolete.

A little demonstration of an artificial neural network that can run on Google Colab with TPU acceleration.
